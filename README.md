## üéØ Overview

As part of the **PyPottery** toolkit, `PyPotteryInk` is a deep learning application for automating the digital inking process of archaeological pottery drawings. It transforms pencil drawings into publication-ready illustrations while preserving the original characteristics and enhancing their analytical power.

## ü§ñ Available Models

| Model | Description | Checkpoint Size | Link |
|-------|-------------|------|------|
| **10k Model** | General-purpose model for pottery drawings | 38.3MB | [Download](https://huggingface.co/lrncrd/PyPotteryInk/resolve/main/model_10k.pkl?download=true) |
| **6h-MCG Model** | High-quality model for Bronze Age drawings | 38.3MB | [Download](https://huggingface.co/lrncrd/PyPotteryInk/resolve/main/6h-MCG.pkl?download=true) |
| **6h-MC Model** | High-quality model for Protohistoric and Historic drawings | 38.3MB | [Download](https://huggingface.co/lrncrd/PyPotteryInk/resolve/main/6h-MC.pkl?download=true) |



All models support custom fine-tuning for specific archaeological contexts or styles.

## ‚ö° Benchmarks


| GPU                 | Processing time for `test_image.jpg` (s) |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 3070Ti (Windows 11) | 51.48                            |
| T4 (Google Colab)   | 57.56                             |

The benchmarks were performed using the `process_single_image` function. 


## üì¢ AI Disclosure and Citation

PyPotteryInk uses Generative AI to translate archaeological pottery drawings into publication-ready illustrations. To promote transparency about the use of Generative AI and proper attribution in scientific research, is required all users to include the following disclosure statement in any publication, presentation, or report that utilizes PyPotteryInk:

```
This research utilized PyPotteryInk (version X.X.X) for the AI-assisted translation of [number] pottery drawings. PyPotteryInk is a generative AI tool developed by Lorenzo Cardarelli (https://github.com/lrncrd/PyPotteryInk).
```

Where you need to specify the software version and the number of processed pottery drawings.

### Usage Reporting
