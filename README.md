## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

For developers who want to contribute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lrncrd/PyPotteryInk.git
cd PyPotteryInk
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues


1. **Out of memory errors**
   - Reduce patch size in settings (try 384 or 256)
   - Close other applications
   - Use CPU mode as fallback (slower but more stable)

2. **Models not downloading**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Models are downloaded from Hugging Face (may be blocked in some regions)
   - Manual download links are available in the table above

3. **Port already in use error**
   - The app now automatically finds an available port
   - If you see this error with older versions, close other Gradio instances
   - Or manually specify a port: `GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=7861 python app.py`

4. **Statistics visualization not showing**
   - Ensure scipy is installed: `pip install scipy`
   - Check that you have at least 2 images for meaningful statistics
   - Verify the "Generate visualization plots" checkbox is enabled

5. **SVG export not working**
   - Install potrace (see Optional Dependencies section above)
   - Ensure potrace is in your system PATH
   - Check that the "Export SVG Versions" checkbox is enabled
   - Note: SVG export works best with high-contrast binary images
