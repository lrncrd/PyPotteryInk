## üéØ Overview

As part of the **PyPottery** toolkit, `PyPotteryInk` is a deep learning application for automating the digital inking process of archaeological pottery drawings. It transforms pencil drawings into publication-ready illustrations while preserving the original characteristics and enhancing their analytical power.
